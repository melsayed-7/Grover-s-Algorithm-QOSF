# Grover's Algorithm

This project is the result of the 3-months [QOSF](https://qosf.org/) mentorship progam. 

The project is the exploration of the designs of Grover's algorithm (ancilla and non-ancilla qubits). Also, we are working now on doing complexity analysis of each design on different qubit-number designs to see how the complexity changes by increasing the number of qubits of the length code of the element to be searched for.


## Getting Started
open the terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/moustafa-7/Grover-s-Algorithm-QOSF.git
``` 
```
cd Grover-s-Algorithm-QOSF
```
installing all dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### How to use

check the file [src/Grover/main.ipynb](https://github.com/moustafa-7/Grover-s-Algorithm-QOSF/blob/master/src/Grover/main.ipynb) to see examples and how to use


## Running the tests
navigate to **src/Grover** and then run this command
```
python3 grover.py
```
